  <h1> Probability Calculator for Catch 21</h1>
  <p>
    Use this tool to calculate the likelihood of outcomes in Catch 21. Green cards indicate the cards that are in play
    and black cards indicate cards that are out of play and cannot be dealt. You enter a target and it will tell you the
    odds of getting that.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, if you have 13 and obviously you need 21, make sure the cards are configured properly and then enter 8
    into the box and press submit. The program will calculate the odds of you being able to get 8 more points by any
    means such as 3 then 5 or a single 8 or two 4s etc. Then it will display the probability of that happening. It has
    no limit on the number of "hits" it may require but it will show the odds of getting to exactly 21. Right now, the
    odds of not busting are not calculated. They also cannot be simply calculated by using the program since the odds of
    getting to 20 in any way possible overlap significantly with the odds of getting to 21. There is, therefore, <b>no
      way
      to calculate your not-busting odds.</b>
